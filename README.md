CREATE DATABASE habitdb;
EXIT;

# Set Up Backend

# Open a new terminal and set up the client
cd ../client
npm install  # Install dependencies
expo start   # Start the React Native app



Windows install
1.   mysql -u root -p (sign in prompt, mysql must be installed prior)

3.   cd server
4.   npm install (if u dont have dependencies)

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
